# Waker
Simple alarm clock application with support for mp3 files.

Couldn't fall asleep one night, because I slept all day, so I figured I'd make an alarm clock that I couldn't just turn off with my phone. I present to you: Waker. 

To try it out, simply download and run the jar file in the bin folder!
